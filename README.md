# Welcome to Kabinet 🌐

This is a early version of a light-weight social media web application. 
Here you can share your ideas 💡 to users across the globe 🌎, or keep it to yourself.    

You can view ideas published by other users, visit a user's collection, bookmark 🔖 any post to your own and of course you can appreciate an idea by dropping a like 💖.

Besides users' contents, you can view what's trending across the media: Google trending 🚀 queries plus articles and headlines 📰 tailored to the country of your residence.

#### Feel free to check it out 🔗 [kabinet-heroku-app](https://kabinet-vn.herokuapp.com). Any feedback is appreciated.
